# Personal Academic Website (Archived)

Academic website hosted at cs.umd.edu/~tlin. 
However, following graduation, I probably don't have access to it anymore,
so the site will just be a redirect to my main website.

I'm kept the original source here, archived, just in case 
(but there's not much there anyway, as I rarely updated the site).
